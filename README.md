Here’s a complete and professional `README.md` for your **AI Image Colorization with OpenCV** project. I’ve included a dedicated section for uploading sample images.

```markdown
# 🖼️ AI Image Colorization using OpenCV & Deep Learning 🎨

This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model to convert grayscale (black and white) images into realistic colorized images using OpenCV and a deep CNN architecture. The application is built with Python and has an interactive UI using **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pavanreddynarva/Image-Colourisation.git
   cd Image-Colourisation
````

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/macOS
   .\venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install required libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🌄 Sample Images

You can test the model using some grayscale images in the `Input_images` folder. After processing, colorized results will be saved in the `Result_images` folder.

### 🔼 Upload Your Own Images

* Add your **grayscale (black & white)** `.png` or `.jpg` images to the `Input_images/` folder.
* The output will be automatically saved to `Result_images/` when you run the app.

---

## 🧠 Model Information

* Model type: `CNN-based` (e.g., U-Net or VGG16-based encoder-decoder)
* Framework: `TensorFlow / Keras`
* Model file: `models/colorization_model.h5` (pre-trained)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
